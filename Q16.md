# Ordering Supplies

Hooray! The party has been given the go-ahead! Now it's time to write a function which will help us to order some supplies for the party.

Northevents Events Supplies™️ sell a range of goods which can help us to throw an amazing party!

The `orderSupplies` function takes two arguments: a supplies object with keys of party supplies and values of the cost of that supply, and the number of guests attending.

It should return a number showing the total cost of ordering one of each item per guest!

## Examples:

```javascript
orderSupplies({ cake: 2, iceCream: 7 }, 2);
// should return 18

orderSupplies({ plates: 2, cups: 1, forks: 1, partyHats: 4 }, 20);
// should return 160
```
