# Find Biggest and Smallest

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the biggest and smallest in an object.

## Example:

```javascript
findBiggestAndSmallest([1, 2, 99, 100]);
// returns { biggest: 100, smallest: 1 }
```

If there is only one number in the array, that will be both the biggest and the smallest.

If there are no numbers in the array, it should return an empty object.
