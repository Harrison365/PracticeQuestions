# Is This Prime?

Write a function that takes a single positive integer as its argument. If the number is prime, it should return `true`. Otherwise, it should return `false`.

(A prime number is a number that is divisible only by itself and 1 - for example 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. The number 1 is not considered a prime number.)

## Example:

```javascript
checkIsPrime(2);
// returns true

checkIsPrime(4);
// returns false
```
