# Gathering Feedback

Phew! All your hard work paid off and the event was a success! Now that you have had some time to relax, it's time to consider the guests feedback.

You decide to break the feedback into three groups: positive (7-10), negative (0-3) or neutral (4-6).

The function gatherFeedback takes an array of arrays, each of these arrays contains both a string of the name of the attendee and a number showing how they rated the party out of 10.

It should return an object with three properties: a key of positive with a value of the number of positive reviews; a key of negative with a value of the number of negative reviews; and, a key of neutral with a value of the number of neutral reviews.

## Examples:

```javascript
gatherFeedback([
  ["maddie", 10],
  ["jatinder", 3],
  ["rose", 6],
]);
// returns {positive: 1, negative: 1, neutral:1}

gatherFeedback([
  ["maddie", 10],
  ["jatinder", 10],
  ["rose", 10],
]);
// returns {positive: 3, negative: 0, neutral:0}

gatherFeedback([
  ["maddie", 10],
  ["jatinder", 10],
  ["rose", 1],
]);
// returns {positive: 2, negative: 1, neutral:0}
```
