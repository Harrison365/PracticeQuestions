# Odd or Even?

Write a function that takes a single integer and returns a string of "odd" if it is an odd number, or "even" if it is even.

## Example:

```javascript
oddOrEven(1);
// returns "odd"

oddOrEven(2);
// returns "even"
```

Note that in many other programming languages, "integer" is a data type. JavaScript only has the Number type, which includes both integers and decimals. For the purpose of this exercise, integer means "whole number".
